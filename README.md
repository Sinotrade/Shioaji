## [Quickstarts](https://sinotrade.github.io/quickstart/)
## Initialization

```python
import shioaji as sj

api = sj.Shioaji()
accounts = api.login("YOUR_TOKEN", "YOUR_SECRET_KEY")
api.activate_ca(
    ca_path="/c/your/ca/path/Sinopac.pfx",
    ca_passwd="YOUR_CA_PASSWORD",
    person_id="person_id of this ca",
)
```
Just import our API library like other popular python library and new the instance to start using our API. Login your account and activate the certification then you can start placing order.


## [Streaming Market Data](https://sinotrade.github.io/tutor/market_data/streaming/)
```python
api.quote.subscribe(api.Contracts.Stocks["2330"], quote_type="tick")
api.quote.subscribe(api.Contracts.Stocks["2330"], quote_type="bidask")
api.quote.subscribe(api.Contracts.Futures["TXFC0"], quote_type="tick")
```

Subscribe the real time market data. Simplely pass contract into quote `subscribe` function and give the quote type will receive the streaming data.


## [Place Order](https://sinotrade.github.io/tutor/order/Stock/)

```python
contract = api.Contracts.Stocks["2890"]
order = api.Order(
    price=9.6,
    quantity=1,
    action="Buy",
    price_type="LMT",
    order_type="ROD",
    order_lot="Common",
    account=api.stock_account,
)
# or
order = api.Order(
    price=9.6,
    quantity=1,
    action=sj.constant.Action.Buy,
    price_type=sj.constant.StockPriceType.LMT,
    order_type=sj.constant.OrderType.ROD,
    order_lot=sj.constant.StockOrderLot.Common,
    account=api.stock_account,
)
trade = api.place_order(contract, order)
```

Like the above subscribing market data using the contract, then need to define the order. Pass them into `place_order` function, then it will return the trade that describe the status of your order.
